# HMK4
In this repository you will find:
> 1) This README.md and a file .gitignore. <br>
> 2) A file **main.ipynb** that is a jupyter file with codes and explanations for the 4 exercises. In exercise 1 you will also find the bonus part for exercise 1 for the exact number of false positives found by the Bloom Filter.<br>
> 3) A **hashing_lib.py** and a **clusters_lib.py** with function used in ex1 and ex3. <br>
> 4) So much pain and hard work.
